이 책의 목적은 당신이 shared-memory parallel machine 을 정확성을 해치지
않으면서 프로그램하는 것을 돕는 것입니다.\footnote{또는, 좀 더 정확히는, 병렬성
없는 프로그래밍에 비해 정확성을 덜 해치면서요.} 우린 이 책의 디자인 원칙이
당신이 적어도 몇몇 병렬 프로그래밍의 함정들은 피하는데 도움을 주길 바랍니다.
즉, 당신은 이 책을 완성된 성당이라기보단 새로 건물을 지을 토대라고 생각해야
합니다.  이를 따르기로 한다면, 당신의 임무는 신나는 병렬 프로그래밍 세계에 진보
--- 결국엔 이 책을 구식으로 만들게 될 진보요 --- 를 가져오는것을 돕는겁니다.
병렬 프로그래밍은 사람들이 말하는 것처럼 어렵지 않습니다. 그리고 우리는 이 책이
당신의 병렬 프로그래밍 과제를 더 쉽고 재밌게 만들길 바랍니다.

%The purpose of this book is to help you program
%shared-memory parallel machines without risking your sanity.\footnote{
%	Or, perhaps more accurately, without much greater risk to your
%	sanity than that incurred by non-parallel programming.
%	Which, come to think of it, might not be saying all that much.}
%We hope that this book's design principles will help you avoid at least some
%parallel-programming pitfalls.
%That said, you should think of this book as a foundation on which to build,
%rather than as a completed cathedral.
%Your mission, if you choose to accept, is to help make further progress
%in the exciting field of parallel programming---progress that will
%in time render this book obsolete.
%Parallel programming is not as hard as some say, and we hope
%that this book makes your parallel-programming projects easier and
%more fun.

짧게 말해서, 병렬 프로그래밍을 과학, 연구, 뭔가 대단한 과제에 적용하려 하면,
그것은 곧바로 엔지니어링 문제가 되어버립니다.  따라서 우리는 특정 병렬
프로그래밍 작업들을 조사하고, 거기서 얻은 것들을 어떻게 다른 곳에도 적용할 수
있는지 이야기합니다.  그러한 적용은, 일부 케이스에서는 놀랍게도 자동화도
가능합니다.

%In short, where parallel programming once focused on science, research,
%and grand-challenge projects, it is quickly becoming an engineering
%discipline.
%We therefore examine specific parallel-programming tasks
%and describe how to approach them.
%In some surprisingly common cases, they can even be automated.

이 책은 성공적 병렬 프로그래밍 프로젝트에 숨어있는 엔지니어링 비법들을 알려주는
것이 새로운 세대의 병렬성 해커들을 느리고 고통스럽게 오래된 바퀴를 다시
만들어내는 대신, 그들의 에너지와 창의성을 새로운 개척자에게 집중하도록 도울 수
있길 바랍니다.
우린 진심으로 병렬 프로그래밍이 당신에게 최소한, 우리에게도 왔던 재미와 흥분,
그리고 도전을 당신에게 가져다 주길 바랍니다.

%This book is written in the hope that presenting the engineering
%discipline underlying successful
%parallel-programming projects will free a new generation of parallel hackers
%from the need to slowly and painstakingly reinvent old wheels, enabling
%them to instead focus their energy and creativity on new frontiers.
%We sincerely hope that parallel programming brings you at least as
%much fun, excitement, and challenge that it has brought to us!

\section{Roadmap}
\label{sec:howto:Roadmap}

This book is a handbook of widely applicable and heavily
used design techniques, rather than
a collection of optimal algorithms with tiny areas of applicability.
You are currently reading Chapter~\ref{chp:How To Use This Book}, but
you knew that already.
Chapter~\ref{chp:Introduction} gives a high-level overview of parallel
programming.

Chapter~\ref{chp:Hardware and its Habits} introduces shared-memory
parallel hardware.
After all, it is difficult to write good parallel code unless you
understand the underlying hardware.
Because hardware constantly evolves, this chapter will always be
out of date.
We will nevertheless do our best to keep up.
Chapter~\ref{chp:Tools of the Trade} then provides a very brief overview
of common shared-memory parallel-programming primitives.

Chapter~\ref{chp:Counting} takes an in-depth look at parallelizing
one of the simplest problems imaginable, namely counting.
Because almost everyone has an excellent grasp of counting, this chapter
is able to delve into many important parallel-programming issues without
the distractions of more-typical computer-science problems.
My impression is that this chapter has seen the greatest use in
parallel-programming coursework.

Chapter~\ref{cha:Partitioning and Synchronization Design}
introduces a number of design-level methods of addressing the issues
identified in Chapter~\ref{chp:Counting}.
It turns out that it is important to address parallelism at
the design level when feasible:
To paraphrase Dijkstra~\cite{Dijkstra:1968:LEG:362929.362947},
``retrofitted parallelism considered grossly
suboptimal''~\cite{PaulEMcKenney2012HOTPARsuboptimal}.

The next three chapters examine three important approaches to
synchronization.
Chapter~\ref{chp:Locking} covers locking, which in 2014 is not only the
workhorse of production-quality parallel programming, but is also widely
considered to be parallel programming's worst villain.
Chapter~\ref{chp:Data Ownership} gives a brief overview of data ownership,
an often overlooked but remarkably pervasive and powerful approach.
Finally, Chapter~\ref{chp:Deferred Processing} introduces a number of
deferred-processing mechanisms, including reference counting,
hazard pointers, sequence locking, and RCU.

Chapter~\ref{chp:Data Structures} applies the lessons of previous
chapters to hash tables, which are heavily used due
to their excellent partitionability, which (usually) leads to excellent
performance and scalability.

As many have learned to their sorrow, parallel programming without
validation is a sure path to abject failure.
Chapter~\ref{chp:Validation} covers various forms of testing.
It is of course impossible to test reliability into your program
after the fact, so Chapter~\ref{chp:formal:Formal Verification}
follows up with a brief overview of a couple of practical approaches to
formal verification.

Chapter~\ref{chp:Putting It All Together}
contains a series of moderate-sized parallel programming problems.
The difficulty of these problems vary, but should be appropriate for
someone who has mastered the material in the previous chapters.

Chapter~\ref{sec:advsync:Advanced Synchronization}
looks at advanced synchronization methods, including memory barriers
and non-blocking synchronization.
Chapter~\ref{chp:Ease of Use} follows up with some ease-of-use advice.
Finally, Chapter~\ref{chp:Conflicting Visions of the Future}
looks at a few possible future directions, including
shared-memory parallel system design, software and hardware transactional
memory, and functional programming for parallelism.

This chapter is followed by a number of appendices.
The most popular of these appears to be
Appendix~\ref{chp:app:whymb:Why Memory Barriers?},
which covers memory barriers.
Appendix~\ref{chp:Answers to Quick Quizzes}
contains the answers to the infamous Quick Quizzes, which are discussed in
the next section.

\section{Quick Quizzes}
\label{sec:howto:Quick Quizzes}

``Quick quizzes'' appear throughout this book, and the answers may
be found in
Appendix~\ref{chp:Answers to Quick Quizzes} starting on
page~\pageref{chp:Answers to Quick Quizzes}.
Some of them are based on material in which that quick quiz
appears, but others require you to think beyond that section, and,
in some cases, beyond the realm of current knowledge.
As with most endeavors, what you get out of this book is largely
determined by what you are willing to put into it.
Therefore, readers who make a genuine effort to solve a quiz before
looking at the answer
find their effort repaid handsomely with increased understanding
of parallel programming.

\QuickQuiz{}
	Where are the answers to the Quick Quizzes found?
\QuickQuizAnswer{
	In Appendix~\ref{chp:Answers to Quick Quizzes} starting on
	page~\pageref{chp:Answers to Quick Quizzes}.

	Hey, I thought I owed you an easy one!
} \QuickQuizEnd

\QuickQuiz{}
	Some of the Quick Quiz questions seem to be from the viewpoint
	of the reader rather than the author.
	Is that really the intent?
\QuickQuizAnswer{
	Indeed it is!
	Many are questions that Paul E. McKenney would probably have
	asked if he was a novice student in a class covering this material.
	It is worth noting that Paul was taught most of this material by
	parallel hardware and software, not by professors.
	In Paul's experience, professors are much more likely to provide
	answers to verbal questions than are parallel systems,
	Watson notwithstanding.
	Of course, we could have a lengthy debate over which of professors
	or parallel systems provide the most useful answers to these sorts
	of questions,
	but for the time being let's just agree that usefulness of
	answers varies widely across the population both of professors
	and of parallel systems.

	Other quizzes are quite similar to actual questions that have been
	asked during conference presentations and lectures covering the
	material in this book.
	A few others are from the viewpoint of the author.
} \QuickQuizEnd

\QuickQuiz{}
	These Quick Quizzes are just not my cup of tea.
	What can I do about it?
\QuickQuizAnswer{
Here are a few possible strategies:

\begin{enumerate}
\item	Just ignore the Quick Quizzes and read the rest of
	the book.
	You might miss out on the interesting material in
	some of the Quick Quizzes, but the rest of the book
	has lots of good material as well.
	This is an eminently reasonable approach if your main
	goal is to gain a general understanding of the material
	or if you are skimming through to book to find a
	solution to a specific problem.
\item	If you find the Quick Quizzes distracting but impossible
	to ignore, you can always clone the \LaTeX{} source for
	this book from the git archive.
	You can then modify \co{Makefile} and \co{qqz.sty} to eliminate
	the Quick Quizzes from the PDF output.
	Alternatively, you could modify these two files so as
	to pull the answers inline, immediately following
	the questions.
\item	Look at the answer immediately rather than investing
	a large amount of time in coming up with your own
	answer.
	This approach is reasonable when a given Quick Quiz's
	answer holds the key to a specific problem you are
	trying to solve.
	This approach is also reasonable if you want a somewhat
	deeper understanding of the material, but when you do not
	expect to be called upon to generate parallel solutions given
	only a blank sheet of paper.
\end{enumerate}
} \QuickQuizEnd

In short, if you need a deep
understanding of the material, then you should invest some time
into answering the Quick Quizzes.
Don't get me wrong, passively reading the material can be quite
valuable, but gaining full problem-solving capability really
does require that you practice solving problems.

I learned this the hard way during coursework for my late-in-life
Ph.D.
I was studying a familiar topic, and was surprised at how few of
the chapter's exercises I could answer off the top of my head.\footnote{
	So I suppose that it was just as well that my professors refused
	to let me waive that class!}
Forcing myself to answer the questions greatly increased my
retention of the material.
So with these Quick Quizzes I am not asking you to do anything
that I have not been doing myself!

\section{Alternatives to This Book}
\label{sec:Alternatives to This Book}

As Knuth learned, if you want your book to be finite, it must be focused.
This book focuses on shared-memory parallel programming, with an
emphasis on software that lives near the bottom of the software stack,
such as operating-system kernels, parallel data-management systems,
low-level libraries, and the like.
The programming language used by this book is C.

If you are interested in other aspects of parallelism, you might well
be better served by some other book.
Fortunately, there are many alternatives available to you:

\begin{enumerate}
\item	If you prefer a more academic and rigorous treatment of
	parallel programming,
	you might like Herlihy's and Shavit's
	textbook~\cite{HerlihyShavit2008Textbook}.
	This book starts with an interesting combination
	of low-level primitives at high levels of abstraction
	from the hardware, and works its way through locking
	and simple data structures including lists, queues,
	hash tables, and counters, culminating with transactional
	memory.
	Michael Scott's textbook~\cite{MichaelScott2013Textbook}
	approaches similar material with more of a
	software-engineering focus, and, as far as I know, is
	the first formally published academic textbook to include a
	section devoted to RCU.
\item	If you would like an academic treatment of parallel
	programming from a programming-language-pragmatics viewpoint,
	you might be interested in the concurrency chapter from Scott's
	textbook~\cite{MichaelScott2006Textbook}
	on programming-language pragmatics.
\item	If you are interested in an object-oriented patternist
	treatment of parallel programming focussing on C++,
	you might try Volumes~2 and 4 of Schmidt's POSA
	series~\cite{SchmidtStalRohnertBuschmann2000v2Textbook,
	BuschmannHenneySchmidt2007v4Textbook}.
	Volume 4 in particular has some interesting chapters
	applying this work to a warehouse application.
	The realism of this example is attested to by
	the section entitled ``Partitioning the Big Ball of Mud'',
	wherein the problems inherent in parallelism often
	take a back seat to the problems inherent in getting
	one's head around a real-world application.
\item	If you want to work with Linux-kernel device drivers,
	then Corbet's, Rubini's, and Kroah-Hartman's
	``Linux Device Drivers''~\cite{CorbetRubiniKroahHartman}
	is indespensible, as is the Linux Weekly News web site
	(\url{http://lwn.net/}.
	There is a large number of books and resources on
	the more general topic of Linux kernel internals.
\item	If your primary focus is scientific and technical computing,
	and you prefer a patternist approach,
	you might try Mattson et al.'s
	textbook~\cite{Mattson2005Textbook}.
	It covers Java, C/C++, OpenMP, and MPI.
	Its patterns are admirably focused first on design,
	then on implementation.
\item	If your primary focus is scientific and technical computing,
	and you are interested in GPUs, CUDA, and MPI, you
	might check out Norm Matloff's ``Programming on
	Parallel Machines''~\cite{NormMatloff2013ParProcBook}.
\item	If you are interested in POSIX Threads, you might take
	a look at David R.~Butenhof's book~\cite{Butenhof1997pthreads}.
	In addition,
	W.~Richard Stevens's book~\cite{WRichardStevens1992}
	covers UNIX and POSIX, and Stewart Weiss's lecture
	notes~\cite{StewartWeiss2013UNIX} provide an
	thorough and accessible introduction with a good set of
	examples.
\item	If you are interested in C++11, you might like
	Anthony Williams's ``C++ Concurrency in Action: Practical
	Multithreading''~\cite{AnthonyWilliams2012}.
\item	If you are interested in C++, but in a Windows environment,
	you might try Herb Sutter's ``Effective Concurrency''
	series in
	Dr. Dobbs Journal~\cite{HerbSutter2008EffectiveConcurrency}.
	This series does a reasonable job of presenting a
	commonsense approach to parallelism.
\item	If you want to try out Intel Threading Building Blocks,
	then perhaps James Reinders's book~\cite{Reinders2007Textbook}
	is what you are looking for.
\item	Those interested in learning how various types of multi-processor
	hardware
	cache organizations affect the implementation of kernel
	internals should take a look at Curt Schimmel's classic
	treatment of this subject~\cite{Schimmel:1994:USM:175689}.
\item	Finally, those using Java might be well-served by Doug Lea's
	textbooks~\cite{DougLea1997Textbook,Goetz2007Textbook}.
\end{enumerate}

However, if you are interested in principles of parallel design
for low-level software, especially software written in C, read on!

\section{Sample Source Code}
\label{sec:howto:Sample Source Code}

This book discusses its fair share of source code, and in many cases
this source code may be found in the \co{CodeSamples} directory
of this book's git tree.
For example, on UNIX systems, you should be able to type the following:

\begin{quote}
	{\scriptsize
	\begin{verbatim}
		find CodeSamples -name rcu_rcpls.c -print
	\end{verbatim}
	}
\end{quote}

This command will locate the file \co{rcu_rcpls.c}, which is called out in
Section~\ref{sec:defer:``Toy'' RCU Implementations}.
Other types of systems have well-known ways of locating files by filename.

As the cover says, the editor is one Paul E.~McKenney.
However, the editor does accept contributions via the
\co{perfbook@vger.kernel.org} email list.
These contributions can be in pretty much any form, with popular
approaches including text emails,
patches against the book's \LaTeX{} source, and even \co{git pull} requests.
Use whatever form works best for you.

To create patches or \co{git pull} requests, you will need the
\LaTeX{} source to the book, which is at
\url{git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/paulmck/perfbook.git}.
You will of course also need \co{git} and \LaTeX{}, which are
available as part of most mainstream Linux distributions.
Other packages may be required, depending on the distribution you use.
The required list of packages for a few popular distributions is listed
in the file \co{FAQ.txt} in the \LaTeX{} source to the book.

To create and display a current \LaTeX{} source tree of this book,
use the list of Linux commands shown in
Figure~\ref{fig:howto:Creating a Up-To-Date PDF}.
In some environments, the \co{evince} command that displays \co{perfbook.pdf}
may need to be replaced, for example, with \co{acroread}.
The \co{git clone} command need only be used the first time you
create a PDF, subsequently, you can run the commands shown in
Figure~\ref{fig:howto:Generating an Updated PDF} to pull in any updates
and generate an updated PDF.
The commands in
Figure~\ref{fig:howto:Generating an Updated PDF}
must be run within the \co{perfbook} directory created by the commands
shown in
Figure~\ref{fig:howto:Creating a Up-To-Date PDF}.

PDFs of this book are sporadically posted at
\url{http://kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/people/paulmck/perfbook/perfbook.html}
and at
\url{http://www.rdrop.com/users/paulmck/perfbook/}.

The actual process of contributing patches and sending \co{git pull}
requests is similar to that of the Linux kernel, which is documented
in the \co{Documentation/SubmittingPatches} file in the Linux source tree.
One important requirement is that each patch (or commit, in the case
of a \co{git pull} request) must contain a valid \co{Signed-off-by:} line,
which has the following format:

\begin{quote}
	{ \scriptsize
	\co{Signed-off-by: My Name <myname@example.org>}
	}
\end{quote}

Please see \url{http://lkml.org/lkml/2007/1/15/219} for an example
patch containing a \co{Signed-off-by:} line.

It is important to note that the \co{Signed-off-by:} line has
a very specific meaning, namely that you are certifying that:

\begin{enumerate}
\item	The contribution was created in whole or in part
	by me and I have the right to submit it under
	the open source license indicated in the file; or
\item	The contribution is based upon previous work
	that, to the best of my knowledge, is covered
	under an appropriate open source License and I
	have the right under that license to submit that
	work with modifications, whether created in whole
	or in part by me, under the same open source
	license (unless I am permitted to submit under
	a different license), as indicated in the file; or
\item	The contribution was provided directly to me by
	some other person who certified (a), (b) or (c)
	and I have not modified it.
\item	The contribution is made free of any other party's
	intellectual property claims or rights.
\item	I understand and agree that this project and the
	contribution are public and that a record of the
	contribution (including all personal information
	I submit with it, including my sign-off) is
	maintained indefinitely and may be redistributed
	consistent with this project or the open source
	license(s) involved.
\end{enumerate}

This is similar to the Developer's Certificate of Origin (DCO) 1.1 used
by the Linux kernel.
The only addition is item~\#4.
This added item says that you wrote the contribution yourself, as opposed
to having (say) copied it from somewhere.
If multiple people authored a contribution, each should have a
\co{Signed-off-by:} line.

You must use your real name:  I unfortunately cannot accept pseudonymous or
anonymous contributions.

The language of this book is American English, however, the open-source
nature of this book permits translations, and I personally encourage them.
The open-source licenses covering this book additionally allow you
to sell your translation, if you wish.
I do request that you send me a copy of the translation (hardcopy if
available), but this is a request made as a professional courtesy,
and is not in any way a prerequisite to the permission that you already
have under the Creative Commons and GPL licenses.
Please see the \co{FAQ.txt} file in the source tree for a list of
translations currently in progress.
I consider a translation effort to be ``in progress'' once at least one
chapter has been fully translated.

As noted at the beginning of this section, I am this book's editor.
However, if you choose to contribute, it will be your book as well.
With that, I offer you Chapter~\ref{chp:Introduction}, our introduction.
